# ReadMe File Generator 

## Description

This application uses node and node packages to give your prompts on your
command line to create you a professional looking readMe file using user input. 
I learned how to implement basic node commands and package.json files to my projects.
I also learned how to import file packages and how to manipulate them in my JavaScript code.
